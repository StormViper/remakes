      <p id="bold">Answer this question. How often do you sit down and just get shit done?</p>
      <p id="paragraph">The answer to this question for most people is resounding <b>NOT ENOUGH!</b></p>

      <p id="bold" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px;">Why?</p>
      <p id="paragraph">Because you're scared. <br><br>Scared of not completing the right task. Scared of missing out on that facebook status. Scared of missing out on thtat important email for Amazon's black Friday sale. Scared of mssing the next episode of Scandal and being out of the loop. <br><br>That fear of missing out makes is distracting you and killing your focus</p>

      <p id="bold" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px;">Now answer this question. What inspires you?</p>
      <p id="paragraph">The answer to this question for most people is achieving your goals and your dreams.<br><br>This is an important question because what inspires you is what focuses you and frees your from the distractions and outside noise.<br><br>We beleive that starting each day by thinking about your goals and what you want to achieve will inspire you, focus your energy, and help you get the right shit done. That's why we created Focus Planner.</p>
